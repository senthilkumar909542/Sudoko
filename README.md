# Sudoko
I developed a Sudoku game on my winning C program without using any inbuilt functions.

Step 1:
I initialized the array with random numbers.
Enter your number, row, columns
---------------------
|0 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 7 0 
|0 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 1 
|0 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
---------------------
|0 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
|0 0 2 |0 0 0 |0 0 8 
|4 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
---------------------
|0 0 3 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
|0 5 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
|0 0 0 |0 0 9 |0 0 0 

Enter the number & position(row and column):1 0 0 
---------------------
|1 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 7 0 
|0 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 1 
|0 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
---------------------
|0 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
|0 0 2 |0 0 0 |0 0 8 
|4 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
---------------------
|0 0 3 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
|0 5 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
|0 0 0 |0 0 9 |0 0 0 

Enter the number & position(row and column):

Step 2:
If you made any mistake, it will show what mistake you made, and your chance count will be decreased.

---------------------
|0 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 7 0 
|0 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 1 
|0 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
---------------------
|0 0 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
|0 0 2 |0 0 0 |0 0 8

|0 0 3 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
|0 5 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0 
|0 0 0 |0 0 9 |0 0 0 

Enter the number & position(row and column):7 0 0 

Duplicate occurs in row!!
